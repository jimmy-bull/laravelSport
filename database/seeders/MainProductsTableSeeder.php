The car is in a good technical condition for its age and it will be sold with a new Dutch periodic vehicle inspection. The engine runs well, has full power and does not have any oil leaks. Optically, the car is not bad but the paint needs attention all around to make it perfect again.

The car has a few nice options such as a sunroof, electric seats, heated seats, electric windows + mirrors and cruise control. All electronics in the car work properly.

The car comes from Canada and was personally imported to the Netherlands. The car has ever had a collision to the front right, otherwise the history of the car is largely unknown. It is only known that the previous owner was an enthusiast and that he had the car in his possession for a long time. The M5 has recently had the necessary maintenance prior to the inspection.

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start.

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start. The car is on original BBS 14\'\' alloy wheels - in addition you can buy a set of BBS 17\'\' wheels for an additional charge (2000 euro) (can be seen in the last photos).

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start. The car is on original BBS 14\'\' alloy wheels - in addition you can buy a set of BBS 17\'\' wheels for an additional charge (2000 euro) (can be seen in the last photos).

The car is with me in Germany and is still registered in Romania as a classic car but the transfer for registration in Germany or elsewhere is no problem.

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start. The car is on original BBS 14\'\' alloy wheels - in addition you can buy a set of BBS 17\'\' wheels for an additional charge (2000 euro) (can be seen in the last photos).

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start. The car is on original BBS 14\'\' alloy wheels - in addition you can buy a set of BBS 17\'\' wheels for an additional charge (2000 euro) (can be seen in the last photos).

The car is with me in Germany and is still registered in Romania as a classic car but the transfer for registration in Germany or elsewhere is no problem.

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start. The car is on original BBS 14\'\' alloy wheels - in addition you can buy a set of BBS 17\'\' wheels for an additional charge (2000 euro) (can be seen in the last photos).

This variant was only produced in 1974 and 1975. A total of 244 copies were built with automatic.

Delivered new in Germany, colour: Siena (metallic brown). Odometer has been read - but probably it is originally 138000 or 238000.

The car was only in Germany until 2019 when it was brought to Norway. A folder with invoices and various other documents since 1984 has been delivered with the car. In 2021 I bought it from there and then brought it to Romania for a complete paint job (rust removed, welded, corrosion treated and painted).

The mechanics were overhauled, brakes renewed, many seals replaced. The engine and transmission were in excellent condition right from the start. The car is on original BBS 14\'\' alloy wheels - in addition you can buy a set of BBS 17\'\' wheels for an additional charge (2000 euro) (can be seen in the last photos).

The car is with me in Germany and is still registered in Romania as a classic car but the transfer for registration in Germany or elsewhere is no problem.

Only 4697 produced.

The GMC Typhoon is therefore the last real, powerful US muscle car to be shrunk into VW Jetta format. Its concept as a revolutionary sports SUV, its technical effort and the resulting driving pleasure are reminiscent of the craziness of the old days. The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Original paint. After 30 years, of course, there are traces of age/small defects (stone chips, mini scratches), but these are only minimal.
2500.00 invested in service parts in 2022.
Valid TuV for Austria. No rust.
Only 45,000 miles!!!!
In this condition, comparable cars cost over €30,000 at dealerships.
Get in and drive.
Increase in value is assured.',

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Original paint. After 30 years, of course, there are traces of age/small defects (stone chips, mini scratches), but these are only minimal.
2500.00 invested in service parts in 2022.
Valid TuV for Austria. No rust.

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Original paint. After 30 years, of course, there are traces of age/small defects (stone chips, mini scratches), but these are only minimal.
2500.00 invested in service parts in 2022.

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

The steel supported chassis, body and all-wheel drive come from the GMC S-15 Jimmy compact SUV, which was already available in 1983 and was also marketed as the Chevrolet S-10 Blazer.

Almost the entire interior and seats of the GMC Typhoon are upholstered in black leather. The rectangular instrument panel and its controls look like a hi-fi receiver.

In April 2022, the car was thoroughly inspected by US Car Special Workshop.
Engine, ignition readjusted.
All belts, steering joints new. Air conditioning modernised to R134, so no problem with refilling. It all works, only the CD player skips from time to time. But everything is original.

Original paint. After 30 years, of course, there are traces of age/small defects (stone chips, mini scratches), but these are only minimal.
2500.00 invested in service parts in 2022.
Valid TuV for Austria. No rust.
Only 45,000 miles!!!!
In this condition, comparable cars cost over €30,000 at dealerships.
Get in and drive.
Increase in value is assured.',
